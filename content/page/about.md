## About the Author
My name is **Beate** and I'm a 2nd-course student in the Academic Master Study Programme «Digital Humanities» with a grand dream of becoming a lecturer one day! 

This blog is not my first dive into website-building, but up to now those experiences were confined in Squarespace-Esque "drag and drop to update" environments.

This new adventure was very exciting - as much as it was incredibly frustrating compared to the aforementioned baby steps in website-building. I never knew it could be this hard to figure out how to put a picture into a website...But here we are! Pictures and all!

### Now - why recommender systems? 
Well, I think they're relevant now more than ever, because we are all currently in the clutches of at least one of these algorithms - whether we like it or not! The pandemic has probably created the perfect setting to be a great feeding ground for filtering systems - everyones stuck inside and you have to do *something*.
Anyone has probably experienced a deep and never-ending content rabbit-hole which can suck you in for literal **hours**. And sometimes it's not even a fun rabbit-hole, but a morbid curiosity fueled inescapable content prison. 

I think - if we have to live with these systems recording our every move on Amazon and every peek in Netflix or Youtube, it's best to at least have a superficial understanding of how they work - maybe it will keep me back from purchasing some strange item I wouldn't want to admit I want, thrown at me by calculating my interests based on that one time I looked up a cat Tutu...

Anyway - thank you for taking a gander here!
