## Energizing Data Scientists
All online commerce giants and social media conglomerates like Amazon, Alibaba, Twitter, Youtube and so on are fighting to get better at solving this one same problem – how to predict which things a user will like given observations of a user's past behaviour.

In 2006 Netflix famously offered a prize to solve this simple problem which had been around for years. This was one of the events that greatly energized research in recommender systems – the **Netflix Prize**. From 2006 to 2009, Netflix sponsored a competition and the rules were simple - Netflix was offering a grand prize of one million US dollars to the team that could successfully compete with the recommendations offered by the company's existing recommender system. Contestants had to work with an offered dataset of more than 100 million movie scores and return recommendations that would be 10% more accurate than those produced by Netflix’s existing recommendation system. This competition riled up data scientists and enthusiasts on the search for new and more accurate algorithms.

Netflixs’ project brought many benefits to the world wide web. Some of the teams took their developed technology and found applications for it in other markets. The team that was just short of winning the grand prize and came in on second place founded a recommendation engine that's active in the RecSys community – Gravity R&D. Later another company created a new solution for ecommerce websites based on the success of the Netflix project. [^2]

Sadly, the Netflix Prize competition raised some problems as well. The dataset offered by Netflix for the  competition raised a number of privacy issues. The datasets were anonymous with the obvious goal of preserving customer privacy, however in 2007, by matching the data sets with film ratings on the Internet Movie Database, two researchers from the University of Texas were able to identify individual users. This resulted with an
anonymous Netflix user suing Netflix on December 2009, alleging that – by releasing the datasets – Netflix had violated United States fair trade laws and the Video Privacy Protection Act. This, as well as red flags raised by the Federal Trade Commission, led to the cancellation of a second Netflix Prize competition in 2010.
